    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Hello, my name is Nicholas Suther and for some time now I have wanted to make money. Actually to say it is something I am passionate about is a understatement. I have been so focused and commited to learning new things though. As I am particularly focused on making as much money as possible sometimes you have to work. That is why I am learning to code as it is a great skill to have, and quite honestly I kind of enjoy to do it.</p>
